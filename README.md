## Data Structures

### Cell
- **Type:** Object
- **Usage:** Represents each cell in the spreadsheet. Contains properties for value, format, and formula.

### Sheet
- **Type:** Object
- **Usage:** Represents a sheet within the spreadsheet. Contains properties for cells, row and column count, and frozen rows/columns.
